        <p>
          Underpinning the CB DAO is a mission to grow on-chain activity and
          adoption of Cardano. This emphasis on tangible metrics and established
          projects distinguishes us from other funding structures.

          <div class="mission-card">
            <h3>Funding High-Impact Initiatives</h3>
            <p>
              Through semi-annual budget proposals, we distribute resources to
              projects that can demonstrate growing on-chain activity and active
              user bases.

          <div class="mission-card">
            <h3>Community Collaboration & Accountability</h3>
            <p>
              By openly sharing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), funded
              projects remain accountable to both the DAO and the broader
              Cardano community.

            <h3>Empowerment Through Decentralization</h3>
            <p>
              Governance decisions, including funding requests to treasury
              withdrawals, go through transparent voting processes enforced by
              on-chain smart contracts, ensuring that no single group can
              unilaterally control funds.

              <p>
                Provide funding for development, and growth for proven projects
                building on Cardano. The goal of all funded projects is to
                become profitable and self-sustaining, so future projects can
                achieve the same through Cardano Builder DAO.

                Cultivate a community where expertise, accountability, and
                feedback flow among Cardano builders. Leverage each other's
                success to create a growth flywheel for Cardano.

              <h3>KPIs</h3>
              <p>
                Projects receiving funds must track and report on metrics like
                on-chain transactions, active users, TVL, downloads, and commit
                activity. This ensures measurable impact and helps prioritize
                proposals that offer the greatest ecosystem benefit.

              <p>
                Each member (project) has one vote, ensuring that no single
                group has an outsized impact on deciding which projects receive
                funding.

              <p>
                Proposals for funding undergo a "temperature check" via a poll
                on the Clarity Platform. Meeting the required voting threshold
                of at least 33% of DAO members is essential, and successful
                proposals must have more upvotes than downvotes to proceed.

              <h3>Treasury Withdrawals</h3>
              <p>
                Every 6 months, on-chain treasury withdrawal proposals are
                submitted as roll-ups of the approved funding requests. 51% of
                all DAO members must approve before smart contracts release the
                funds. This stringent requirement safeguards against
                misallocation of resources.

                The treasury is established using ADA allocated to CB DAO from
                the Cardano Treasury. A treasury deposit would flow directly
                into the smart contract governed treasury. The CB DAO will
                leverage an Agora DAO to collectively govern funds.

                withdrawal proposals. Voting and executing these withdrawals is
                all done on-chain, ensuring transparency and security.

                Any treasury funds left unspent at the end of the budget period
                are returned to the Cardano Treasury, and the CB DAO is
                dissolved for that cycle, ensuring funds are not indefinitely
                locked away.
